# Stackline Full Stack Assignment

## Overview

This is a sample eCommerce website that includes:
- Product List Page
- Search Results Page
- Product Detail Page

The application contains various bugs including UX issues, design problems, functionality bugs, and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Your Task

1. **Identify and fix bugs** - Review the application thoroughly and fix any issues you find
2. **Document your work** - Create a comprehensive README that includes:
   - What bugs/issues you identified
   - How you fixed each issue
   - Why you chose your approach
   - Any improvements or enhancements you made

We recommend spending no more than 2 hours on this assignment. We are more interested in the quality of your work and your communication than the amount of time you spend or how many bugs you fix!

## Submission

- Fork this repository
- Make your fixes and improvements
- **Replace this README** with your own that clearly documents all changes and your reasoning
- Provide your Stackline contact with a link to a git repository where you have committed your changes

We're looking for clear communication about your problem-solving process as much as the technical fixes themselves.
